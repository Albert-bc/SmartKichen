# Gesture Recognition for Kitchen Enthusiasts

Our project offers a hands-free gesture recognition solution, primarily designed for individuals in the kitchen. Navigate recipes, control music, and more using simple hand gestures.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

## Before start
You need to make sure that your operating system is windows 10 and above and that groove music is installed on your computer.

## Gesture recognition
We have divided gesture recognition into two types: scene gestures and in-scene gestures.
### Scene gestures
From clenched fist to extended palm: Dashboard

Number 2: Open timer

Number 3: Open music

Number 8: Open recipe website

### In-scene gestures
On the timer, the top right of the index finger represents plus 30 seconds and the bottom left represents minus 30 seconds. The number 6 means pause or continue the timer.
In a music scene, up and down on the index finger means volume up and down, and left and right on the index finger means previous and next song. The number 6 means pause or play.
In the recipe scenario, pointing up and down with the index finger means scrolling up and down on the page, while pointing left and right with the index finger means selecting interactive elements vertically. The number six will click on interactive elements.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
MediaPipe library
You can install the required libraries using pip:
``pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui pillow``

and run by ``python app.py``
